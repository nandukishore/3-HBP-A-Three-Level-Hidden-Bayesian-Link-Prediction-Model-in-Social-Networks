# 3-HBP-A-Three-Level-Hidden-Bayesian-Link-Prediction-Model-in-Social-Networks
 It integrates three levels of hidden Bayesian modeling to predict links among users effectively. By analyzing user behavior and relationships, 3-HBP leverages latent interest distributions, Gaussian weighting, and hidden naive Bayesian algorithms to improve link prediction performance.
